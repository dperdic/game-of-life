# Solana Conway's Game of Life

This project was created for the Solana Summer Fellowship 2024 demo day.

## Description

The project consists of a program used to store packed and encrypted 32X32 boards and a NextJS app that allows the user to create a new board, mint a compressed NFT which is the proof of ownership over the board, upload the packed and encrypted board to the program, and play the created board.

The encrypted boards can be fetched by anyone but they can only be decrypted and unpacked by the owner of the compressed NFT. NFTs are transferrable so the owner can give theirs to someone else to enjoy the game they have created.
